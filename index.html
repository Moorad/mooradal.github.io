	<h2>Development/Design</h2>
	<p>I have developed many games, applications, websites and web apps. I'm very good at using 3 programming languages Python, Javascript and C#. I started coding at the age 12 so I know quite a bit of programming. I've also developed programs and website that other people asked me to make for them. I'm not the best at designing but I can manipulate images, create grahic images like a background or a logo and I can design websites. I know the basics of Video Editing like adding effects and adding/removing clips from a video but I didn't go very deep. If you want me to make you anything contact me by going to the contact page then we will discuss your request.</p>

	<h2>Tools</h2>
	<p>When programming you have a lot of choices for a source code editor to choose from. I personally use to use Sublime Text 3 as my main source code editor which I recommend but now I use Atom editor. Atom editor is free and can be linked with my Github Repositories Easily because the developers of Atom editor are GitHub. I use photoshop and paint.net to edit and create images.</p>

	<h2>Future</h2>
	<p>I want to make products that are better than other popular more big compaines products. I also want to make a lot of Open source software where the community edit my product and create better more advance features.</p><br/>
